I have taken part in 3 hackathons that have helped me immensely in understanding where I lack and what new skills and technologies I need to learn and what the best practices are, in the industry.`;

export const aboutme3 = `I strongly believe that good communication and leadership lead to great results and I have been fortunate to have successfully led multiple teams in hackathons and other technical events. Apart from founding the college e-Magazine, I was also in-charge of various college events that ended up being super successful. I consider myself creative and hardworking, as my stats show.
